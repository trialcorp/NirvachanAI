# NirvachanAI 🇮🇳

> An interactive, AI-powered civic education platform that guides Indian voters through every step of the election process — from eligibility to post-vote engagement — using seven integrated Google Cloud services, a cinematic 3D experience, and WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility.




---

## 💡 Chosen Vertical

**Civic Education for Indian Voters** — empowering 950+ million eligible voters with accessible, AI-driven guidance across all 6 types of Indian elections (Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Assembly, Panchayat, Municipal, By-election).

India's democratic process involves multiple election types, complex eligibility rules, and diverse regional languages. NirvachanAI bridges this knowledge gap by providing a single, inclusive platform that educates voters at every step — from checking eligibility to understanding post-election engagement.

## 🧠 Approach and Logic

### Design Philosophy: "DOM-First" Architecture

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Decisions:**
1. **The accessible HTML is the source of truth** — not the 3D scene. This ensures the app is fully functional for screen readers, keyboard users, and low-powered devices.
2. **Every Google Cloud service has a graceful degradation path** — static fallbacks ensure the app works offline or without API keys.
3. **Gemini function calling orchestrates all services** — the AI coach dispatches queries to Translation, Maps, Vertex AI FAQ, eligibility validation, and timeline services in real-time.
4. **Zero external assets** — the 3D scene uses procedural geometry (dodecahedrons, particles, canvas text sprites) resulting in an ultra-lightweight payload.

## ⚙️ How the Solution Works

### 7-Stage Election Journey
Users navigate through a guided journey covering:
1. **Eligibility** — age/citizenship check, NRI voter status
2. **Registration** — online (Form 6), offline, and transfer procedures
3. **Candidate Research** — affidavit access, constituency info
4. **Voting Methods** — EVMs, VVPAT, postal ballots, NOTA
5. **Election Timeline** — deadlines, key dates, reminder setup
6. **Polling Day** — ID requirements, booth location, voting hours
7. **Post-Vote** — result tracking, election petitions, civic engagement

### AI-Powered Election Coach (Gemini + Function Calling)
The conversational assistant uses Gemini's **function calling** to dynamically dispatch user queries to specialised services:

| User Query | Tool Called | Service |
|---|---|---|
| "Am I eligible to vote at 17?" | `check_voter_eligibility` | Local validation |
| "Translate this to Hindi" | `translate_text` | Cloud Translation API |
| "Where is my polling booth?" | `find_polling_location` | Google Maps Places API |
| "What is NOTA?" | `lookup_election_faq` | Vertex AI semantic search |
| "What are the key election dates?" | `get_election_timeline` | Local timeline data |

### Semantic FAQ Search (Vertex AI)
Uses `text-embedding-004` to convert voter questions into 256-dimensional vectors, then matches against a pre-embedded FAQ corpus using cosine similarity. FAQ corpus embeddings are **computed once and cached permanently** — subsequent queries only require embedding the user's question.

---

## 📐 Assumptions Made

1. **Google Cloud Account:** The developer has access to a GCP project with the following APIs enabled: Generative Language, Maps JavaScript, Places, Cloud Translation, Cloud Natural Language, and Firestore.
2. **Node.js 20+:** Required for Vite, TypeScript, and testing toolchain.
3. **Modern Browser:** Target browsers support ES2022, WebGL 2.0, and `IntersectionObserver`. The app degrades gracefully for older browsers.
4. **Internet Access for AI Features:** Google Cloud API calls require network connectivity. All AI features have offline fallbacks.
5. **Indian Election Context:** All election data, rules, and procedures are sourced from the Election Commission of India (ECI) as of 2025-2026.
6. **No User Authentication:** The platform is purely educational — no user accounts, no PII collection, no login required.
7. **API Key Security:** API keys are restricted to specific domains and API surfaces via the GCP Console (see `SECURITY.md`).

| 4 | **Google Maps** | `src/services/maps.ts` | Places API + dynamic map + embed fallback + geolocation | ⭐⭐⭐ Deep |
| 5 | **Google Calendar** | `src/services/calendar.ts` | Deep-link generation for 4 election events (no OAuth) | ⭐⭐ Moderate |
| 6 | **Cloud NL API** | `src/services/analytics.ts` | Entity extraction + sentiment analysis on voter queries | ⭐⭐⭐ Deep |
| 7 | **Cloud Firestore** | `src/services/analytics.ts` | Anonymised event logging via REST (no SDK overhead) | ⭐⭐ Moderate |

**Infrastructure:**
- **Google Cloud Run** — containerised deployment via Docker + nginx

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- Google Cloud account with APIs enabled (see `.env.example` for required services)

### Steps

1. **Prepare the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd NIRVACHAN-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   cp .env.example .env
   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and add your Google Cloud API keys. See `.env.example` for documentation on each key.

4. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
    The app opens at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deployment (Google Cloud Build)

The project includes a `cloudbuild.yaml` for automated deployment to Cloud Run. To ensure AI and Translation features work in production, you **must** set the following **Substitutions** in your Cloud Build Trigger:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API Key |
| `_MAPS_API_KEY` | Your Google Maps JavaScript API Key |
| `_TRANSLATION_API_KEY` | Your Google Cloud Translation API Key |

1. Go to **Cloud Build → Triggers** in the GCP Console.
2. Edit your trigger and scroll to **Substitutions**.
3. Add the three keys above with their respective values.
4. Run the trigger to redeploy with the keys embedded.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Maps not loading | Ensure `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set and the Maps JavaScript API is enabled in GCP |
| Coach shows "offline mode" | Set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` — the app falls back to static responses without it |
| Translation not working | Enable Cloud Translation API and set `VITE_GOOGLE_TRANSLATION_API_KEY` |
| Build fails on Windows | Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for deterministic installs |

---

## 📜 Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the local Vite development server |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript check + production bundle |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run test` | Run all unit and integration tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with code coverage report |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint on all TypeScript source files |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript compiler check (no emit) |
| `npm run validate` | Gatekeeper: typecheck + lint + all tests |

## 🏛️ Architecture Highlights

### DOM-First Design
The accessible DOM (`#accessible-fallback`) is the absolute source of truth. The 3D scene is a progressive enhancement. If WebGL is unavailable or `prefers-reduced-motion` is set, the app degrades gracefully to a standard accessible website with full functionality.

### Security Posture
- **Robust CSP** with `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` for seamless local development and production reliability.
- **Strict-dynamic ready** for deployment via `nginx.conf` headers.
- **Multi-layer sanitisation:** `sanitizeFull()` = truncate → removeControlChars → stripHtmlTags → escapeHtml → trim
- **Input debounce:** 500ms debounce on chat submissions prevents API spam
- **API key restrictions:** documented in `SECURITY.md` with GCP Console instructions
- API keys loaded exclusively from environment variables

### Offline Resilience
Every Google Cloud service has a graceful degradation path:
- **Gemini:** Static keyword-matched responses for 8 common voter topics
- **Vertex AI:** Keyword-based FAQ fallback with pre-cached corpus embeddings
- **Translation:** Returns original text when API key absent or request fails
- **Maps:** Returns sample polling locations when API unavailable
- **Calendar:** Always works — uses pure URL deep-links, no API required
- **Analytics:** Fail-silent via `requestIdleCallback` — never blocks the voter experience
